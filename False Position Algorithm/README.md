# False Position Algorithm
--------------------------
This is an algorithm which finds the root of a function at the desired amout of error and number of iterations. The function will provide es and maxit if you do not add them.

### Inputs
* func(Your function you want to use false position on)
* xl(Lower Guess)
* xu(Upper Guess)
* es(The desired error)
* maxit(Maximum number of iterations)

### Outputs
* root(The root estimated at that iteration) 
* fx(The function eveluated at the root position)
* ea(Approximate relative error(%))
* iter(The number of iterations preformed)
