# Simpson's 1/3 Algorithm
--------------------------
This is an algorithm which integrates Data using Simpson's 1/3 rule. If the data is not viable for Simpson's 1/3, the Trapazoid rule will be used.

### Inputs
* x(Values of one of your matricies equally spaced)
* y(Values of one of your matricies)


### Outputs
* I(Area under the curve)
